I could not answer Amazon request but I'm glad.
So let go on furher.
Demo question for AMzon assesment were:
1.FSM state machine
- 8 cells, if prev and next cell has a diff state, cell in middle has active state in following iteration,
otherwise cell in middle will be inactive, it is presumeable that head and last position will be active in each next state.
Get the states after n days?  
inputs: int[] states,int days 


2.GDC(great commomn division)(Eucklid) algorithm? 
inputs: int [] arr, int arraySize
